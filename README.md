## Hi, I'm Em!

I'm a **cognitive psychologist** with a passion for understanding how we learn and make sense of the world. My PhD research explored how surprising information shapes learning and attention, combining **behavioral experiments, computational modelling, and neuroimaging analysis**. I'm currently looking at how font design impacts our ability to spot typos in digital text.

### Beyond Research 🌿🏕️  
When I’m not analyzing data, you’ll probably find me **backcountry camping, hiking, or cycling**—I love exploring the outdoors and getting away from all things digital.   

Feel free to check out my work or reach out—I'm always up for a good discussion about brains, data, and cool research!
