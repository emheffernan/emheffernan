## Hi, I'm Em!

I'm a **cognitive psychologist** with a passion for understanding how we learn and make sense of the world. My PhD research explored how surprising information shapes learning and attention, combining **behavioral experiments, computational modelling, and neuroimaging analysis**. I'm currently looking at how font design impacts our ability to spot typos in digital text.
